# Learn Pycharm Ep. 2
## By Murillo Maiorano
 - 2024, 16 years old.
 - On this document, I will share all my journey to learn pytorch and machine learning.
 - Im mostly doing that in a matter to learn faster while having fun, but also having hopes on that in the future, look back to that and see how much I evolved.
 - Dont be harsh on English errors, thats my second language.
    - If you find any, please reach out so I can fix it.
- Keep in mind thats a for fun project and I dont recommend using it to study, since im studying myself.
